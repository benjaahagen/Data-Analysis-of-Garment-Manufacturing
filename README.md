# Data Analysis of Garment Manufacturing

This project presents a data analysis of a garment manufacturing company. The analysis focuses on various aspects of the company's operations, including team productivity, the difficulty of production processes, the impact of rest days on productivity, and the distribution of employee incentives.

## Key Questions Explored
1. Does the individual teams' actual productivity exceed their targeted productivity, and which team is the most/worst productive?
2. Which of the two garment production processes (i.e., sewing and finishing) is the hardest?
3. Which of the days is mostly the rest day for the workers and how does the resting affect their productivity afterwards?
4. When does the company pay more incentives to its workers? And do both sewing and finishing departments enjoy the same incentives?
5. How does the number of style changes impact productivity?
